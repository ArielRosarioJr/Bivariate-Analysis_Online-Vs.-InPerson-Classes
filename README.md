# README for ELA 101 Course Performance Analysis at NotReal University

## Introduction

This repository contains the data and analysis code for a study conducted at NotReal University to compare the educational outcomes of students in an introductory English class, 
ELA 101. The study focuses on the academic performance difference between students who attended in-person classes and those who participated online.

## Study Overview

The goal of this research was to investigate and contrast the academic performance of students in the Introduction to English (ELA 101) course based on the mode of 
attendance - in-person vs. online. Utilizing the Welch Two Sample t-test, the study uncovered a significant disparity in the mean test scores between the two groups, 
highlighting the impact of the learning mode on student performance.

## Key Findings

- The Welch Two-Sample t-test revealed a significant difference in final ELA scores between in-person and online students, with a t-value of 13.72 and degrees of freedom of 86.126.
- The p-value obtained is less than 2.2e-16, strongly rejecting the null hypothesis and confirming a statistically significant difference in mean scores.
- The 95% confidence interval for the difference in means is between 13.68 to 18.32.
- In-person students had a mean score of 84.5, which is significantly higher than the 68.5 mean score for online students.

## Implications

These findings suggest that in-person learning may be more effective for students in the ELA 101 course at NotReal University. This calls for further research 
to understand the diverging trends in online and in-person learning outcomes and their implications across different majors.


## Future Work

Further research is needed to comprehensively understand the impact of learning modes on student outcomes, potentially expanding the scope to include 
different majors and courses at NotReal University.
